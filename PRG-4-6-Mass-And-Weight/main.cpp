//  Scientists measure an object's mass in kilograms and its weight in newtons. If you know
//  the amount of mass that an object has, you can calculate its weight, in newtons, with
//  the following formula:
//
//  Weight = mass * 9.8
//
//  Write a propgram that asks the user to enter an object's mass, then calculates and displays
//  its weight. If the object weighs more than 1,000 newtons, display a message
//  indicating that it is too heavy. If the object weighs less than 10 newtons, display a message
//  indicating that the object is too light.
